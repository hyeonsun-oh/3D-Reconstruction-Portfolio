# Hyeonsun Oh's Portfolio

Welcome! 👋  
I'm Hyeonsun Oh, a senior undergraduate student majoring in Data Science, with a focused interest in 3D reconstruction, medical image visualization, and AI-based perception for robotics.

I began my academic path in Mechatronics, earning an associate degree in engineering,  
which provided me with a solid foundation in mechanical design, control systems, and embedded electronics.  
This technical background led to 4+ years of hands-on experience developing robotic and medical devices — including catheter controller and sample collection robot.

While working in the field, I frequently encountered a critical limitation:  
Anatomical structures were often represented only in 2D, making spatial understanding and simulation difficult.

This challenge sparked a strong interest in reconstructing real-world and medical environments into 3D —  
not only to improve human interpretation and surgical planning, but also to enable intelligent robots to understand complex spatial information.
